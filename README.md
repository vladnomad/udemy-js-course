### Description

This course is aimed at learning JavaScript in detail, with the goal to immediately put it into practice.

Each theoretical block ends with practice, where you will write an application, interactive elements on the site, etc.

The 2nd part of the course is about the most popular JavaScript-based library - React.js (version 18) with all the necessary technologies (including Redux).
